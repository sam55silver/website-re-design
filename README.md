# Website Re-Design

the website can be viewed at: https://samsilver.ca/farmers-market/

This was a project for my ART Design class. The goal of this project was to create a piece of art with design fundamentals in mind. I chose to create a website using pure HTML and Tailwind. My subject was to re-design the Antigonish Farmers Market website: https://www.antigonishfarmersmarket.ca/

The Antigonish Farmers Market is a local market for farmers from the surrounding area to attend and sell their produce and crafts.

## DISCLAIMER

All the photos used in the creation of this website are not mine! I used the photos from the Antigonish Farmers Market website for this re-design. This project was purely for educational purposes.

I also used the free version of Font Awesome for some of the icons within the design.

## Design

I decided to go with a simple flat design with earthy colors to match a local farmer feel. I used a mixed of Serif font to give a more professional feel to the website. This font helped bring the business aspect that the farmers are portraying at the market.

This design is fully flexible for any screen size. I used a little bit of javascript to make the menu buttons dynamic for smaller screens on mobile phones.
